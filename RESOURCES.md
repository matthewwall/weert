# Useful resources

## Node

This document informs how WeeRT handles errors in the server.
[Error Handling in Node.js](https://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors)

WeeRT pretty much follows this guide on RESTful services.
[RESTful Service Best Practices](http://www.restapitutorial.com/media/RESTful_Best_Practices-v1_0.pdf)

More tips on designing good RESTful services.
[Best Practices for Designing a Pragmatic RESTful API]
(http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api)

Documentation of the WeeRT RESTful API is inspired by the superb [GitHub API documentation]
(https://developer.github.com/v3/). However, without their resources, it can only be aspirational, rather than
literal.

## Angular

Useful tutorial on Angular. A good place to start. [PhoneCat Tutorial App](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial)

How to structure Angular apps. [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)

Very useful article for understanding factories, *et al.* Good examples of how to use deferreds in
a factory. I finally "got it" after reading this.
[AngularJS: Factory vs Service vs Provider](http://tylermcginnis.com/angularjs-factory-vs-service-vs-provider/).

WeeRT uses [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) for many user interface elements. It's bootstrap
written using Angular components. Same CSS styling.

Also uses [Angular-xeditable](http://vitalets.github.io/angular-xeditable/) for text that can be edited
in place.
