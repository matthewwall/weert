# weert
A real-time interface to weewx using Node, Express, and D3.

## General architecture
- Uses a [Node](https://nodejs.org/) server
- Data is stored in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) server
- The server receives packet updates from weewx via a RESTful interface
- The server then sends the new packets on to clients through a Websocket
connection (using [socket.io](http://socket.io/)).
- When a new client connects to the weert server, it can receive up to 
an hour's worth of loop data.
- After that, the display is updated with every new loop packet
- Real-time plots are done using [D3](http://d3js.org/).

For experimental purposes.
