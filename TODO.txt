SERVER

Test using query parameters for getting platforms (GET /api/v1/platforms)

Check for missing timestamps when submitting a packet.

Look at using EventEmitters instead of PubSub.

CLIENT
If windDir is null, WindCompass should not show anything (rather than the last value or zero).

The Websockets need a keep-alive strategy.

The WeeRT server should log startup to syslog.

Need to be more tolerant of null values.

Brush needs a clip path.

If brush includes the extreme right of the x-axis domain, it should always
include the last point.

The y-domain of the focus area needs to change when the brush is active.

Need to deal with data gaps.

A settable "minimum domain" for the y-axis.
