Brush needs a clip path.

If brush includes the extreme right of the x-axis domain, it should always
include the last point.

Pretty up the y-axis, especially for the overview plot.

Need to deal with data gaps.

A "keep alive" strategy for the websocket. They seem to be getting dropped.

A settable "minimum domain" for the y-axis.

Only store an hour or so worth of data on the client.

The data stored in Mongo could use a better naming scheme. Something
like "outside_temperature" instead of "outTemp."
