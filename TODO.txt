SERVER

Need to define a proper data model.

Use dateTime as the _id in the databases. Saves space on an index.

The data stored in Mongo could use a better naming scheme. Something
like "outside_temperature" instead of "outTemp."

CLIENT
If windDir is null, WindCompass should not show anything (rather than the last value or zero).

The Websockets need a keep-alive strategy.

The WeeRT server should log startup to syslog.

Need to be more tolerant of null values.

Brush needs a clip path.

If brush includes the extreme right of the x-axis domain, it should always
include the last point.

The y-domain of the focus area needs to change when the brush is active.

Need to deal with data gaps.

A settable "minimum domain" for the y-axis.
